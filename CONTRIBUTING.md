# Team Norms
## Team Values
* Communication should take place via the group Slack channel
* Everyone’s ideas should be heard and valued, and everyone’s voice is equally important
* Any questions or concerns should be freely communicated with the group, and a team member should respond to questions within 24 hours
* Conflicts or differing opinions should be addressed via Slack or at a Standup. The team should try and solve problems diplomatically and through compromise, only deferring to the project owners as a last resort.
## Sprint Cadence
* Individual tasks will be assigned at the beginning of the two-week sprint periods.
* Standups to be held twice a week, 9PM on weekdays (exact dates TBD)
* Members are expected to be synchronously present for Standups.
* Team members should not go two standups without making any progress. Doing so with no prior warning or explanation should result in consultation with management.
## Coding Standards
* Team members are expected to use Prettier to standardize code formatting
* Make small, meaningful comments throughout code for clarity
* Use descriptive variable and function names
* Do not leave dead code in product that is pushed
## Git Workflow
* Pull the latest code from the main branch first!
* Make a new branch locally with a good name to work on new features or edit existing features. Name branches name/feature (ex. janet/create-card-editor).
* Once changes are made, push the branch back to the remote repository and make a pull request for your code to be reviewed. If you have made any visual changes, be sure to include a screenshot.
* If the code is approved, merge with the trunk.
