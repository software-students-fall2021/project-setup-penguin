## Wireframes

### Deck Creation

The first screen (Create a new deck) is the default landing page where people can immediately create a new deck for their team. The second screen wraps up the deck creation flow.

### Deck Viewing

After 1) creating a deck or 2) clicking a link to an existing deck, users are taken to this screen where they can view existing cards and create new ones.

### Card Creation

These screens are shown when the user wants to create a new card. They are prompted to create an optional account that enables them to come back and edit their card.
