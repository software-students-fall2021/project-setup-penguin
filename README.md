Deployed with DigitalOcean at http://143.198.163.107/

## Project Description

Our product allows users to create fun Pokemon-inspired trading cards highlighting various salient traits about themselves such as thier superpowers, weaknessses, communication preferences and more. Each team will start with a "dek" of cards and team members will create profile cards to add to the deck. We envision that team members would be able to learn more about each other by looking at profiles in the "dek", and in turn build a strong foundation for future teamwork to grow on.

## Product Vision Statement

For the everyday student or worker, who needs help connecting with their team members and coworkers, Pokedek is a mobile/web application that simplifies and streamlines relationship building through personalized cards that showcase interests and individuality.

## Minimum Viable Product

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will allow users to create and share a card template with other team participants.
Our MVP Features:

- Creating a card template with customizable questions and features that a user is most interested in learning about their teammates
- Filling out a card template with a user's personalized information and joining a team
- Sharing their team so others can also fill out their cards

## Project History

This project was inspired by the intern project our team member Janet Huang did during her internship at Asana. Pokedek was proposed in early October of 2021, and aims to help individuals connect with groups and teams in a fun, and streamlined manner.

To date, the Pokedek team has completed a wireframe and clickable prototype for the application.

## Building and Testing

To start the application,

- In `/back-end` directory, run `npm install` then `node server.js`
- In `/front-end` directory, run `npm install` then `npm start`
- Open up http://localhost:3000/!

To run tests,

- In `/back-end` directory, run `npm test` â€“ this doesn't seem to work on some machines, so an alternative is `npx mocha test/routes.js`
